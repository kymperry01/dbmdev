# Tasks to improve the package
# 1. devParamsDf is actually a matrix, but function works with both. Correct, or update documentation
#


# Potential bug notes/fixes
# 1. mlocDev: "stages" outout does not work properly (outputs in listed format) is cbind is used in the last code line instead of bind_cols.
# 2. mlocDev, new version of function, 'bind_rows' step to view together gives warnig 'unequal factor varibales, coercing to character). 
# 3. mlocDev/RevDev/FwdDev: it would be convenient to give option (argument) when to bind the results to the full original dataframe, 
# ... instead of simply outputting columns in a df, which then need to be merged by `site` with original df. 
# ... build inside fwdDev and revDev.
# 4. choice to output as list (as per current, with each gen in a separate df) or as single dataframe (simply add bindrows step inside function)
# 5. choice to output generations in `long` or `wide` format. For wide, call the below function inside main functions:
castGens <- function(x){ # x if a df. see R script `autumnClimate.R`.
  x %>%
    mutate(gen = paste0("dev0G", gen)) %>%
    dcast(site ~ gen, value.var = c("dev0")) %>%
    # parse the numeric datetimes back to POSIXct (coerces to matrix)
    mutate_each_(funs(as.POSIXct(., origin = "1970-01-01")),
                 vars = list(quote(-c(site))))
  }

  
# For `total` lifecycle, calculating cumulative deveopment should come standard in the output.
# Specifying start or end date should be an option (to calculate cumdev between a specific time window).
  
  
# Should be able to run all sorts of startDev at once and get a separate column output for each! Fix!!
# you want the same data_frame returned with an extra column added with the predicted output!
# You at least need the startDate returned! (you do, it is called dev0. But that's misleading, because the first stage might have been dev0.5? Call it startDev?)
# need to handle the warnings when binding rows (coercing factor to character) - add stringsAsFactors = FALSE somewhere earlier. warning caused by last step in mlocDev function
# dev0 and dev1 is confusing ... which way round depends on whether fwd or reverse modelling!
# you need better error message when biofix (startDate or startDev) is missing (NA). Or skip these rows.
# timedir is a stupid name for an argument. should be `direction`
# you need better, more intuitive package and function names.
# it just `has` to keep all the columns from the input data.frame! It is the group_by %>% summarise steps inside fwdDev etc that are the problem.
