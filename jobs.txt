# remove dependencies: magrittr
# hide function bodies when you run the bare function name in the console
# you shouldn't change to output from dataframe to tibble silently. Perhaps use an option to output as nicer tibble (tibble = TRUE).
# consideradd a function to convert fahrenheit to celsius, for overseas users? Or auto detect the location of input data and prompt this conversion?
# In sample_df, ensure set seed does not change user state
# Add code for how models were fitted to the package so that it can be re-generated at any time 
# Access gridded climate data for Australia to predict development at any location

# Predict development
# Allow multiple locations in one function?
# User shoud be able to query the output to find out a timepoint when a particular event happened ("egg lay", or completion of pupal development (eclosion).
# Perhaps make this "end_stage" arg. Separate function to query the output?
# Add a time delay value for moth/egg lay days. Default to one. Provides a user specified gap between generations.
